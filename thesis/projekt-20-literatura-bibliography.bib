              levels of the Chomsky hierarchy, with a special emphasis on
              context-free and regular languages. It then recapitulates the
              arguments why neither regular nor context-free grammar is
              sufficiently expressive to capture all phenomena in the natural
              language syntax. In the second part, two refinements of the
              Chomsky hierarchy are reviewed, which are both relevant to the
              extant research in cognitive science: the mildly
              context-sensitive languages (which are located between
              context-free and context-sensitive languages), and the
              sub-regular hierarchy (which distinguishes several levels of
              complexity within the class of regular languages).},

  abstract  = {The Zephyr Abstract Syntax Description Language (ASDL) describes the abstract syntax of compiler intermediate representations (IRs) and other tree-like data structures. Just as the lexical and syntactic structures of programming languages are described with regular expressions and context free grammars, ASDL provides a concise notation for describing the abstract syntax of programming languages. Tools can convert ASDL descriptions into the appropriate data-structure definitions and functions to convert the data-structures to or from a standard flattened representation. This makes it easier to build compiler components that interoperate.Although ASDL lacks subtyping and inheritance, it is able to describe the Stanford University Intermediate Format (SUIF) compiler IR, originally implemented in C++. We have built a tool that converts ASDL into C, C++, Java, and ML data-structure definitions and conversion functions. We have also built a graphical browser-editor of ASDL data structures. ASDL shares features found in many network interface description languages (IDLs), algebraic data types, and languages such as ASN.1 and SGML. Compared to other alternatives ASDL is simple and powerful. This document describes ASDL in detail and presents an initial evaluation of ASDL.},

abstract = {A new technique of free-space simulation has been developed for solving unbounded electromagnetic problems with the finite-difference time-domain method. Referred to as PML, the new technique is based on the use of an absorbing layer especially designed to absorb without reflection the electromagnetic waves. The first part of the paper presents the theory of the PML technique. The second part is devoted to numerical experiments and to numerical comparisons with the previously used techniques of free-space simulation. These comparisons show that the PML technique works better than the others in all cases; using it allows us to obtain a higher accuracy in some problems and a release of computational requirements in some others.}
